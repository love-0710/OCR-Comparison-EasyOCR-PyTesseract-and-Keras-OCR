# OCR-Comparison-EasyOCR-PyTesseract-and-Keras-OCR
**Project Overview**
  *The OCR Comparison Project evaluates three popular Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools:

-  EasyOCR
-  PyTesseract
-  Keras OCR
<br><br>This project aims to compare the performance of these tools in terms of accuracy, speed, and ease of use. We focus particularly on a detailed comparison between EasyOCR and Keras OCR across various image datasets containing printed, handwritten, and distorted text.

**Introduction**
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is essential for digitizing printed or handwritten text in images. This project implements and compares three major OCR tools—EasyOCR, PyTesseract, and Keras OCR—to determine which is most suitable for different use cases, including printed, handwritten, and complex texts.

**Technology Stack**
-  Python 3.x
-  Libraries:
-  EasyOCR
-  PyTesseract
-  Keras OCR
-  OpenCV (Image pre-processing)
-  Pillow (Image loading)
  
**Features**
-  Multi-tool OCR support: Easily perform OCR using EasyOCR, PyTesseract, or Keras OCR.
-  Dataset flexibility: Test the OCR tools on any image dataset of your choice.
-  Performance evaluation: Automated comparison of speed, accuracy, and ease of use between the tools.
-  Result visualization: Outputs both raw OCR results and evaluation metrics.

**Results**
-  EasyOCR: Good balance of speed and accuracy, works well with printed text, and is easy to set up.
-  PyTesseract: Decent for basic text extraction, but struggles with distorted or complex text, and has slower performance.
-  Keras OCR: Best for challenging text, especially handwritten or distorted text, but is slower than EasyOCR.
