# OCR-Comparison-EasyOCR-PyTesseract-and-Keras-OCR
Project Overview
The OCR Comparison Project evaluates three popular Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools:

EasyOCR
PyTesseract
Keras OCR
This project aims to compare the performance of these tools in terms of accuracy, speed, and ease of use. We focus particularly on a detailed comparison between EasyOCR and Keras OCR across various image datasets containing printed, handwritten, and distorted text.

Introduction
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is essential for digitizing printed or handwritten text in images. This project implements and compares three major OCR tools—EasyOCR, PyTesseract, and Keras OCR—to determine which is most suitable for different use cases, including printed, handwritten, and complex texts.

Technology Stack
Python 3.x
Libraries:
EasyOCR
PyTesseract
Keras OCR
OpenCV (Image pre-processing)
Pillow (Image loading)
Features
Multi-tool OCR support: Easily perform OCR using EasyOCR, PyTesseract, or Keras OCR.
Dataset flexibility: Test the OCR tools on any image dataset of your choice.
Performance evaluation: Automated comparison of speed, accuracy, and ease of use between the tools.
Result visualization: Outputs both raw OCR results and evaluation metrics.
